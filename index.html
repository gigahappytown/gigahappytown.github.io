    <h1>Art is Red</h1>

<p>
  People define art diferently. I believe that
  <a href="https://genius.com/Her-words-kill-art-is-red-lyrics">
    <strong>ART IS RED</strong>
  </a>.<br>
  Art is often beautiful. Sometimes it contains meaning. <br>
  So what do I mean when I say that "Art is Red"? <br>
  The way I see it, there is only one criteria that makes something art. <br>
  Art takes something from the artist. This is always true. Art is red.<br>

      If you guys are interested, you should check out some shoegaze artists. I really like: <em> My Bloody Valentine, LSD and the Search for God, Whirr, Nothing, and Slowdive</em>.
